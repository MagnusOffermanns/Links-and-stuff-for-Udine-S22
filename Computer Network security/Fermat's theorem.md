[wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem)

If p is prime for any integer a the number $a^P-a$ is an integer multple of p:

$$a^P \equiv a (mod(p))$$

special case:

if $p$ is prime and $a$ is a positive integer not divisible by p then 
$$a^{p-1}\equiv 1 (mod(p))$$
